// This is a backup of the original 1005-line Search component
// The component has been refactored into smaller, more manageable pieces
// This file is kept for reference purposes

// Original component was too large and is available in git history
// The refactored version uses:
// - Custom hooks for state management (useSearchState, useVideoFiltering, useSearchLogic)
// - Smaller UI components (ModeSelector, MoodSelector, SearchFilters, etc.)
// - Better separation of concerns
// - Improved performance through memoization
// - Enhanced maintainability
